# 100 Days of Code
Day 1-3:
1. overtime-calculator
This is a simple python overtime calculator.

It mainly has 3 selections: 
The first selection allows users to input the start and end datetime for the overtime rendered.
Note: this is a datetime which means the user has to input the date & time, i.e. start time: 04/10/2019 19:00
end time: 04/10/2019 21:00.

The second selection will add the number of OT hours from the first selection.
The third selection will quit the program.

To run this program just type on the command-line: python overtime-calc.py

2. Pomodoro program
This program uses the pomodoro technique to start a timer with an initial duration of 25 mins. After 25 mins the user has to take a break for 5 mins. When that short break runs out, the pomodoro duration of 25 mins will start again. When the user has taken 4 pomodoros, he/she will be allowed to have a longer break of 20 mins. When this break is finished, the pomodoro timer will again begin at 25 minutes.
