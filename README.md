# overtime-calculator
This is a simple python overtime calculator.

It mainly has 3 selections: 
The first selection allows users to input the start and end datetime for the overtime rendered.
Note: this is a datetime which means the user has to input the date & time, i.e. start time: 04/10/2019 19:00
end time: 04/10/2019 21:00.

The second selection will add the number of OT hours from the first selection.
The third selection will quit the program.

To run this program just type on the command-line: python overtime-calc.py
